# Secure by design

Safety is very important to the team at Forrest. For this reason, we have built security into the tool from the beginning.

- Before a command is executed, the user is shown the exact command. This must be confirmed once.


- If you want to bypass the confirmation of the command, this is only possible as long as the signature of the command has not changed.


- Commands can be marked as not runnable. These will then only be displayed, but not executed.
