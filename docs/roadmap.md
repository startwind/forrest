# Roadmap

- Version 2.0.0 - **Data Powered and Context Sensitive** - In version 2.0.0 we focus in the commands and our database. This will be fed by other open source projects like [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/) or [Warp Workflows](https://github.com/warpdotdev/workflows). As this database will already be very big we will adjust the usage of Forrest a little bit. The search will be the central service. As it will still be a lot of commands we know we also decided to implement a context-sensitive approach. For example if Forrest recognizes it was run within a PHP project, we will show all the PHP commands. It will also store the recent commands you called in this specific directory.


- Version 3.0.0 - **Forrest Community** - In version 3.0.0 we focus on collaboration. We know that such a project is only successful when a lot of people use it. We want the the team and community feature to become more important. Sharing and limiting access to commands without manual effort and GitHub workarounds is key.


- Version 4.0.0 - **Forrest AI** - Everybody talks about it and we will also implement it. If forrest does not find a suited command in the database it will use AI to suggest a possible one.
